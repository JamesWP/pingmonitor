An OS X dashboard widget that monitors a ping running on a single remote IP address. The widget displays latency and connection status.

## Features ##

None, really.

## Bugs ##

  * The custom remote address is not persistent across restarts.
  * No "factory settings" or equivalent button.
  * Ping interval cannot be set
  * Scale for the color-coded widget is arbitrary
  * IPv6 is not supported
  * Latency should be averaged over several pings to get something marginally more meaningful
